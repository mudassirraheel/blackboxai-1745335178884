# User Workspace

## Project Overview
User Workspace is a Node.js application that provides a simple server to generate unique tracking links. The application uses Express.js to handle HTTP requests, and it allows users to generate a tracking link which can then be used to serve a tracking page. This is mainly intended for demonstration purposes and showcases basic link generation with UUIDs.

## Installation

To get started with User Workspace, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-workspace.git
   cd user-workspace
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can start the server with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`. You can generate a unique tracking link by navigating to the following endpoint in your browser:

```
http://localhost:3000/generate-link
```

Once you have the link, you can use it to access the tracking page by visiting:
```
http://localhost:3000/track/{id}
```
Replace `{id}` with the specific UUID that you received from the previous endpoint.

## Features

- **Generate Unique Links**: Automatically generate a unique tracking link using UUIDs.
- **Track Links**: Serve a specific tracking page when the unique link is accessed.
- **In-Memory Storage**: Stores generated links in a Set for quick validation (suitable for demo purposes).

## Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies, as listed in `package.json`:

- [`express`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express): A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- [`uuid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid): A library to generate unique identifiers (UUIDs).

Install these and any other dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

## Project Structure

```

├── node_modules/          # Node.js packages installed by npm
├── public/                # Directory for public assets (like HTML files)
│   └── track.html         # The tracking page served for valid links

In the above structure, `server.js` contains the core application logic, while the `public` directory is used for any static files that the server serves.
