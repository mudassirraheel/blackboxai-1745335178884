# User Workspace

## Project Overview
User Workspace is a simple Node.js application that generates unique tracking links using Express.js and UUID. The application serves a static HTML page for tracking links that were generated, providing an easy way to create and access these links. This project is intended for demonstration and educational purposes.

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd user-workspace
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server**:
   Once the dependencies are installed, start the server with:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

To generate a unique tracking link, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/generate-link` in your web browser. This will return a JSON response containing your newly generated link. You can use this link to access the tracking page at `http://localhost:3000/track/{id}`, where `{id}` is the unique identifier returned in the previous step.

## Features

- Generate unique tracking links.
- Serve static HTML page for link tracking.
- Validate links ensuring that only existing links can be accessed.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies found in the `package.json` file:

- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework for building web applications.
- **UUID**: A library for generating unique identifiers based on a standard algorithm.

```json
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^5.1.0",
  "uuid": "^11.1.0"
}
```
